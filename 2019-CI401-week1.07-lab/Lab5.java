// Here are some more advanced things to try with the maze set-up.
// Don't worry if you can't do them - they are not essential (and do
// ask for help if you want to try them)
// They do require you to change some of the other classes, so it might 
// be a good idea to create a second BlueJ project to do this in, so
// you don't have to change the names of everything.

// NB: Game2 and Game3 implements some of these thigns, so have a go at it yourself
// before looking at them in detail

// - Add one or more GameObjects for non-player characters (NPC) you may meet
//   in different rooms (eg pets or people), You will need to update the 
//   Room class to have another contents type - a new instance variable 
//   and an update to the contents() method to show the new character i a room.
//   HINT: copy the code for the treasure in Room and Game1 as the basis for this.
// - Add another type of NPC for a 'zombie' with an updateZombie method in the
//   game loop which makes them move around (how will you decide what path 
//   they take?). Change checkGameOver so that if the player encounters a 
//   Zombie the game finishes.
// - Add a second player, who responds to different input command letters, and has a different
//   identifier character.
// - ADVANCED: investigate the java Random class to see how to introduce 
//   random start positions for players and treasure, and different movement
//   strategies for ghosts moving.
